# 🧪 3D Carbon Atom Structure (HTML + CSS)

A 3D visual model of a Carbon atom created using only HTML and CSS. This project was built as part of my high school (Class 12) assignment to combine science and web development in a creative way.

## 🔬 What It Shows
- The nucleus of the Carbon atom (protons & neutrons)
- Electron shells with electrons orbiting around
- Purely created with HTML and CSS – no JavaScript or external libraries used

## 🎯 Features
- 3D-style animation using CSS `transform` and `animation`
- Realistic orbital motion for electrons
- Responsive layout (optional based on your design)
